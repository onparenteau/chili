          <p class="card-text">Lynx hybrids, also known as "lynxcats" or "blynx", are the offspring of bobcats and Canada lynx. They have larger bodies, smaller feet, and some lynx-like features, like long ear tufts and black-tipped tails. However, the hybrids are not protected and may be hunted by hunters. Some odd-looking lynx may be color morphs of either bobcats or Canada lynx, which could lead to the death of protected Canada lynx. My parents have had two hybrid lynx cats. The first one was named Titus and the second one is named Mika. Mika is now 3 years old and shes so pretty and loves to explore outside.</p>
